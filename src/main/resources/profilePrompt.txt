 Given this profile:
%s

Given this message:
%s

Return only the updated profile.
Update it when the user show some preferences, ask for something or some behaviour change or ask you to remember something important.
Also, if you find important information (such as name, age, profession, location, skills),
write it on the new profile.
For example, if the user tells their name is something different from the profile, change it.
Your answer will be used as the new profile, answer only the profile to be saved.
Do not record every action on the profile, only lasting information.
For example, name should be on the profile but last message sent should not.
